Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch
This repository showcases the implementation of several machine learning algorithms from scratch, applied to different datasets. The focus is on building these algorithms without the use of external machine learning libraries, demonstrating a deep understanding of their inner workings.

Implemented Algorithms:
Simple Linear Regression (from scratch): Developed a linear regression model to predict a continuous target variable based on a single input feature.

Multiple Linear Regression (from scratch): Extended the linear regression model to predict the target variable using multiple input features, all implemented manually.

Logistic Regression (from scratch): Implemented a binary classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome using a logistic function.

K-Means Algorithm (from scratch): Built the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch, which partitions the dataset into k distinct clusters based on feature similarity.

Gradient Descent (from scratch): Created the gradient descent optimization algorithm to minimize the cost function, updating parameters iteratively to achieve convergence.
